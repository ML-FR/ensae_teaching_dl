    I don't have GPU when running my unit test,
    so I use CPU. So I got the following error:

    ::

        beignet-opencl-icd: no supported GPU found, this is probably the wrong opencl-icd package for this hardware

    This article might be useful
    `Install OpenCL on Ubuntu 17.04, intel
    <https://askubuntu.com/questions/952164/install-opencl-on-ubuntu-17-04-intel>`_.
    I tried:

    ::

        apt-get install beignt clinfo

    Not really working. I might have to read this one
    `How to set up OpenCL in Linux
