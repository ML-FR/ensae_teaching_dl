    I discovered the python module
    `MMdnn <https://github.com/Microsoft/MMdnn>`_
    which implements many conversions between frameworks,
    from :epkg:`tensorflow` to :epkg:`pytorch` and many others
    (see `tested models <https://github.com/Microsoft/MMdnn#tested-models>`_).
    It does propose a visualizer too:
    `MMDNN Visualizer <http://mmdnn.eastasia.cloudapp.azure.com:8080/>`_.
    And many models can be downloaded:
    `Model Collection <https://github.com/Microsoft/MMdnn/blob/master/mmdnn/models/README.md#model-collection>`_.
    Available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/mmdnn/#description>`_.
